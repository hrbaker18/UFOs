## Overview

An in-depth analysis of UFO sightings was created on a website that allows users to filter for multiple criterie at the same time. Filters were added to allow those utilizing the website to search by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFOs. 

### Using the UFO Sightings Website

#### The Search Bar

### Summary 

#### Drawbacks and Further Recommendations 

While the updated filter criteria are a massive plus for the website, users need to know the specific cities, dates, and shapes in order to accurately search through the UFO sightings. Additionally, when using the filters, everything must be in lowercase letters specifically, otherwise the filters will not return results. 

Two recommendations below would significantly update the functionality of the website and allow for ease of use:
- Adding a function to allow users to search using any type of capitalization or spacing when typing in states, cities, or countries
- A dropdown menu under the "Shape" filter for simplicity
